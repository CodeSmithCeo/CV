## Work Experience

### Senior Frontend Web Developer

_CodeSmith - sole proprietorship, Zagreb, Croatia, 5/2019 – ongoing_

I have held various roles in the development process, from **lead developer**, **sole developer/designer**, to an external member **of clients' development teams**. Throughout my tenure, I have collaborated with **multiple contractors** on diverse **big data** and **machine learning projects**. These initiatives have encompassed some less common concepts — **real-time data management**, **selective data persistence**, **charting**, **visualizing mathematical graphs**, **audio visualization and management** and more. Leveraging my expertise in **ReactJS, TypeScript, Redux, RTK, MUI, JointJS, ECharts**, and other technologies, I have been instrumental in both maintaining existing SPAs and spearheading the development of new ones.

Additionally, I have played a significant role in shaping the development process, establishing **robust code standards**, implementing **best practices**, and providing **mentorship** to less experienced team members. My ability to make informed technical decisions has created a **template/backbone for several of the client's future projects**.


### Full-stack Web Developer

_Neoinfo d.o.o., Zagreb, Croatia, 04/2017 – 05/2019_

During this engagement, I **transitioned into the role of a full-stack developer**, and within the first year, **assumed the position of the lead developer's right hand**, eventually replacing him by his recommendation on his departure. My responsibilities encompassed the full range of the fullstack, from refining CSS to optimizing database performance on a project developed for an insurance company. The stack used was:  AngularJS (styled with **Bootstrap**), **ASP.NET (C#)** (augmented with **Entity Framework**), and a **Microsoft SQL Server** database.

The result was the **expansion of contracting company business from Croatia to the Italian market, with the Italian partner selecting me as the primary point of contact**, increased performance and far more maintainable code.

The **development team experienced a 40% reduction in size**, even as the application managed over **three times the volume of data**, allowing for the redistribution of human resources elsewhere.

### Frontend Web Developer

_Snowfall d.o.o., Zagreb, Croatia (sadly, closed months after my departure), 03/2016 – 04/2017_

Envisioned and developed an **automated end-to-end testing solution** using **Selenium** and **WebDriverIO**, integrated with **BrowserStack**, for over 90 different versions of an **Ember**-based payment portal for **Panasonic WISP** in-flight purchases, which significantly enhanced our ability to test both the core and vendor-specific changes by a magnitude of a hundred.

Made significant contributions to the codebase as a member of a team using **AngularJS**, **Ionic**, and **Cordova** to develop multiple user group applications for the Swedish transportation company **MTR**.

### Frontend Developer

_TEB Informatika d.o.o., Zagreb, Croatia, 08/2015 – 03/2016_

Due to my adaptability, enthusiasm and sheer fascination with the idea of developing a single (PW/SP)-A, I was chosen by the CTO to embark with him on a journey to explore the idea.

We employed an innovative approach at the time, utilizing **AngularJS**, **Ionic**, and **Cordova** and deployed an idea of solution across iOS, Android, and Windows Phone operating systems. Shortly after I was assigned a team of four to start over and develop a fully-featured app commissioned by **Hrvatske ceste d.o.o., the Croatian national road management company**.

At this point I became fully immersed in the entire project lifecycle, from requirement gathering to final testing and maintenance planning while **acting as the primary liaison**  between the CTO, the commissioner, and the team, ensuring seamless communication and alignment of project objectives.

Using the above approach we pioneered several new ideas in the company, including **real-time positioning**, an incident reporting system with **push notifications**, and a true **offline mode**, setting new standards for next projects.
It has **reduced total development time and costs by over 70%** when compared to previous standards. 

### Frontend and Android Developer

_TEB Informatika d.o.o., Zagreb, Croatia, 05/2014 – 08/2015_

Contributed to various web applications, primarily focusing on **design and UI**, occasionally implementing business logic based on detailed specifications.

Solely converted one of the applications, focused around merging **real-time video data with GPS coordinates and user input**, to a **native Android application**.


### Tutor and Programmer

_Self-employed, Zagreb, Croatia, 05/2010 – 05/2014_

During my time as a self-employed tutor (starting during my senior years of college), I provided personalized instruction to high school and college students across a broad spectrum of subjects, including various programming languages such as **Pascal, Basic, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, SQL, PL/SQL**, and more. Over the course of several years, I had the privilege of guiding over 100 students.

Through this experience, I **honed my soft skills**, especially the **ability to communicate complex concepts in a clear and accessible manner**, fostering an environment conducive to learning and growth. I also improved **problem-solving skills*, as I often encountered unique challenges that required creative solutions.

While I initially considered establishing my own tutoring company, I ultimately decided to pivot towards being involved in the industry before doing so.
