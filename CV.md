## Work Experience

### Senior Frontend Web Developer
*CodeSmith - sole proprietorship, Zagreb, Croatia, 5/2019 – ongoing*

I have held various roles in the development process, from **lead developer**, **standalone developer/designer**, to **developer** as en external member of a team. Throughout my tenure, I have collaborated with **multiple contractors** on diverse **big data** and **machine learning projects**. These initiatives have encompassed **real-time data management**, **selective data persistence**, **advanced charting**, and **mathematical graph drawing**. Leveraging my expertise in **React, TypeScript, Redux, RTK, MUI, JointJS, ECharts**, and other technologies, I have been instrumental in maintaining existing or spearheading the development of new SPAs. 

Additionally, I have played a significant role in shaping the development process, establishing **robust code standards**, implementing **best practices**, and providing **guidance** to less experienced team members. My ability to make informed technical decisions has created a **backbone for several of client's future projects**.


### Full-stack Web Developer
*Neoinfo d.o.o., Zagreb, Croatia, 04/2017 – 05/2019*

During this engagement, I transitioned into the role of a full-stack developer, and within the first year, assumed the position of the lead developer's right hand. My responsibilities encompassed a wide range of tasks, from refining CSS styles to optimizing database performance for a project developed for an insurance company, based on **AngularJS** (styled with **Bootstrap**),  **ASP.NET** (augmented with **Entity Framework**), and a **Microsoft SQL Server** database.

Leveraging my academic background and innate ability to quickly grasp new concepts, I adeptly tackled challenges such as shifting mindset to a strongly typed language (**C#**), navigating the .NET ecosystem efficiently, and extending capabilities of the existing ER model or remodeling it to increase performance. The result was the **expansion of their business from Croatia to an Italian market, with the Italian partner selecting me as the primary point of contact**, increased performance and far more maintainable code (resulting in a **60% reduction in the development team**).

### Frontend Web Developer
*Snowfall d.o.o., Zagreb, Croatia (sadly, closed months after my departure), 03/2016 – 04/2017*

Designed and developed independently, an automated end-to-end testing solution using **Selenium** and **WebDriverIO**, integrated with **BrowserStack**, for over 90 different versions of an Ember based payment portal for **Panasonic WISP** in-flight purchases. 

Made a noticeable contribution to both the codebase and code optimization as a member of a team using **AngularJS**, **Ionic**, and **Cordova** to develop multiple user group application for the Swedish transportation company MTR.

### Lead Frontend Developer
*TEB Informatika d.o.o., Zagreb, Croatia, 08/2015 – 03/2016*

Led a dedicated frontend team outsourced to the **Croatian national road management company - Hrvatske ceste d.o.o**. Played an integral role throughout the entire project lifecycle, from requirement gathering to final testing and maintenance planning. Acted as the primary liaison between the team, CTO, and the client, ensuring seamless communication and alignment of project objectives.

The project entailed the development of a SPA utilizing **AngularJS**, **Ionic**, and **Cordova**, tailored to operate as a native app for mobile devices and tablets across iOS, Android, and Windows Phone operating systems. This approach significantly **reduced development time and costs by over 70%**. Notably, the application pioneered advanced features for non-native apps, including **real-time positioning**, an incident reporting system with **push notifications**, and an **offline mode**, setting new standards in mobile app functionality at the time.

### Frontend and Android Developer
*TEB Informatika d.o.o., Zagreb, Croatia, 05/2014 – 08/2015*

Contributed to various web and native Android applications, specializing in UI/UX design and the implementation of code based on specifications.

### Tutor and Programmer
*Self-employed, Zagreb, Croatia, 05/2012 – 05/2014*

Tutored high school and college students in multiple subjects, including coding in various scripting and programming languages such as Basic, C, C++, Java, JavaScript, SQL, PL/SQL, and more.

## Projects

*Please note: All projects I have worked on are covered by Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDAs), limiting the level of detail I can provide here. However, I am available to discuss them further during the interview process. The projects I completed during my employment are detailed in the Work Experience section. Below, you'll find a list of projects I undertook as a freelancer.*

### Hawk-a-doc - Unstructured Data Extraction and Management Platform

As the developer with the most experience embedded within the in-house team, I took the lead in overhauling our outdated tech stack to bring it in line with modern standards. My primary objective was to select a contemporary and reliable stack that the team could seamlessly transition to, consisting of well-established technologies meticulously picked for the specifics of the project requirements.

Following the initial setup, I introduced established design patterns and provided foundational code to implement essential functionalities such as routing, security, styling, theming, and data management in a simple, clear and consistent manner. The resulting code base served as a template for others to both learn from and build upon during subsequent development phases. Additionally, I established coding conventions, structure, and naming conventions to streamline collaboration within the team.

Throughout the project lifecycle, I was frequently called upon to address challenging decisions, develop specific functionalities, and resolve complex issues encountered by both individual team members or the team as a whole.


### Atomic-graph - Graphing Library

After deliberating between using the limited free version of JointJS and the paid version (JointJS+), I was presented with an initiative to explore building on top of the free version to meet our specific requirements. However, upon closer examination, several significant deficiencies in the free version became apparent, including unreliable code, inadequate documentation, outdated dependencies written. These shortcomings led me to conclude that using the free version directly in a serious project would not be wise, a sentiment later confirmed by the project manager.

As a result, a decision was made to develop a tailored, in-house library that would address these deficiencies and meet our specific needs. My task was to achieve the flexible list of requirements, leaving me with open hands to redefine it when additional functionality could be developed with minimal resources spent or when an inessential aspect became too time-consuming. The result took approximately 20% more time than the original estimate but included all of the essential and about 70% of features we originally labeled as impossible to achieve even in the double time frame. The result, in the form of a nmp package as is successfully integrated into two distinct projects, with plans for additional integrations in the future.

By opting for this approach instead of the paid version, the contractor stands to save approximately six to ten thousand dollars per month in licensing fees alone. Moreover, the custom solution provides extended functionality and seamless integration that was not found in any of the available libraries we researched during the requirement listing phase.


### Stem and Jam - Music Processing Application MVP

Developed a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) to demonstrate a machine learning-powered solution tailored for the music industry. The solution offers advanced instrument and vocals recognition, as well as the capability for extraction, subtraction, or enhancement of specific instruments or vocals through a user-friendly interface


### AiPanda - Data Management Platform

I have collaborated as an external partner with the in-house team on a project focused on managing structured and semi-structured data in its advanced stages of development. The project encountered numerous challenges, including legacy errors and inconsistencies, various code styles, redundant and conflicting libraries, inconsistent data state, and more resulting in significant accumulation of technical debt,  among the most severe I've encountered. Reflecting on the project, it became evident that the underlying issue was not solely a lack of manpower, as initially stated, but rather a need for strategic intervention to address the above.

To address these challenges, I undertook several key interventions. This included identifying and resolving dependencies, clarifying roles and responsibilities, refactoring complex code into a more maintainable structure, reorganizing component hierarchy, improving API naming  and optimizing API interactions. Additionally, I established clear guidelines for code structuring, integrated linters and formatters, and advocated for the adoption of best practices where applicable.

As a result of these efforts, the team and I successfully transitioned the project to a more sustainable state and moved it into the maintenance phase before I was contracted to work on a different project. While specific metrics of success were not provided, the project's improved stability and readiness for maintenance represent tangible outcomes of our collaborative efforts.


### NIA - Network Intelligence Analytics Application

As a freelance and a sole frontend developer on an in-house project focused on big data analytics, specifically targeting captured network traffic. The outcome was a sophisticated, low-latency, widget-based Single Page Application (SPA) meticulously designed to empower clients in visualizing and distilling vast datasets into actionable insights. Harnessing innovative technologies using a user-centric approach, the product enables users to seamlessly transition from receiving warnings about potential issues to analyzing them and receiving recommendations for their resolution.
